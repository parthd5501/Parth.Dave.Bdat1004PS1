    "•\t5 - This is an integer data type (int).\n",

    "•\t5 * 2 - This is an integer data type (int). The expression evaluates to 10.\n",
    "•\t'5' * 2 - This is an integer data type (int). The character '5' is implicitly converted to its ASCII value (53) and then multiplied by 2. The expression evaluates to 106.\n",
    "•\t'5' + '2' - This is a string data type (string). The characters '5' and '2' are concatenated to form the string \"52\".\n",
    "•\t5 / 2 - This is an integer data type (int). The expression evaluates to 2. Note that integer division truncates the decimal part.\n",
    "•\t5 % 2 - This is an integer data type (int). The expression evaluates to 1, which is the remainder of the integer division.\n",
    "•\t{5, 2, 1} - This is an array data type (int[] or List<int>). It represents an array or list of integers with values 5, 2, and 1.\n",
    "•\t5 == 3 - This is a boolean data type (bool). The expression evaluates to false.\n",
    "•\tPi (the number) - The data type depends on the context. In C#, if you are referring to the mathematical constant Pi, you can use the Math.PI constant, which is a double data type (double)."
